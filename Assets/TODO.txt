TODO:
- Notes for other side of board
	- Add a bool for if the note is the player's?

- Music
	- Vocals
		- Could be a single track (Like FnF, Rock Band, etc.) or individual syllables (like piano tiles).
			- Single track
				- Easy to program
				- Assets can only be used once
				- Only one song is needed to load
				- Needs external program to edit song
				- Simpler but not as cool (opinion)
			- Individual syllables
				- More difficult to program
				- Reusable assets
				- Loading of many files required
				- Allows editing the song in the Json rather than through an external program
				- Guaranteed sync to beatmap (hitting the note plays the sound)
				- POSSIBLE PROBLEMS
					- Each sound someone can make will need an audio file (long a, short e, long o), will each note of each sound need a separate clip? (G long a, B sharp short o, etc.)
					  If so, file size will increase drastically. If it can be pitch shifted in unity, how can we ensure the sounds arent distored?

- Characters
	- Effect to move the camera to target a character (or center of them)
	- Animations
		- How would sprites be loaded? 
			Xml file or Json could be used for the sprites, but they might need to be individual files, which could take a long time to load (Not sure)
		- Up, Down, Right, Left, Idle, and miss sprites for all directions
		- How to make animations in runtime? might need to use a separate script rather than unity's animation system?

- Asset loading changes
	- Arrows loaded through streaming assets rather than being "hardcoded"

FINISHED:
(Only stuff that's on the todo will be here)
